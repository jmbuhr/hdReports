# hdReports

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of hdReports is to supply Rmarkdown templates for 3 occasions:

- A Bachelor's or Master's thesis at Heidelberg University in the faculty of Biology and Chemistry
- A research report for the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS)
- A research presentation for the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS)

## Installation

You can install hdReports from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmbuhr/hdReports")
```

Or even better: Use the `renv` package to manage your dependencies and use:

``` r
renv::install("jmbuhr/hdReports")
```

Learn more about `renv` [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)

## Usage

In Rstudio create a new Rmarkdown file and choose **From Template**. There you will find:

- Heidelberg Thesis
- HITS Research Report
- HITS Research Presentation
